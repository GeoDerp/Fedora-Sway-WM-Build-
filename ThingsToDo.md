# List Of Things To Do
Before I can call it finished

- [x] FIX ALBERT, [*Error.md*](https://github.com/GeoDerp/Fedora-Sway-WM-Build-/blob/master/AlbertErrors.md), [*Issue*](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/issues/768) 
[**Update:** it kinda works, it's using x not wayland and has a tendency to not run on startup (that may be an sway issue) ]
- [ ] Figure out bug with waybar, [*Error.md*](https://github.com/GeoDerp/Fedora-Sway-WM-Build-/blob/master/WaybarError.md), [*Issue*](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/issues/182) 
- [ ] Load workspace script
- [ ] Figure out Waybar's overlay button problem
- [ ] Upgrade Install script, until my OCD has been met
- [ ] Upgrade Waybar with plugins and custom modules (like weather)
- [x] Make sure all font awesome icons work in install
- [ ] Learn how to make a GDM theme, and maybe even a Grub
- [ ] Make irssi config
- [ ] Make Atom theme, upgrade UI and add plugins 
- [ ] Upgrade Terminal and rice 
- [ ] Add Vim theme 
- [ ] Make thumbnail/gif for readme.md 
- [ ] Turn Sway,wlroots,waybar,swaylock,swayidle build into a automated rpm to allow easy install,update and uninstall (mainly for updates).
*Might use something like (open build service)[https://openbuildservice.org/] to automate the process of pulling the latest version of the git repo + the spec file and auto compile into an rpm*
- [x] Figure out issue with swaylock not acceptkng password [24/2/19](https://github.com/GeoDerp/Fedora-Sway-WM-Build-/commit/5db0a8b39b4cdc83d8a9ba77414aab04889958c1)
