# List Of Things To Do
### Before I can call it finished:

- [x] FIX OPEN SUSE [BUILD PACKAGES](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:GeoDerp:redflower) 
- [x] FIX ALBERT, [*Error.md*](https://github.com/GeoDerp/Fedora-Sway-WM-Build-/blob/master/AlbertErrors.md), [*Issue*](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/issues/768) 
[**Update:** it kinda works, it's using x not wayland and has a tendency to not run on startup (that may be an sway issue) ]
- [x] Figure out bug with waybar, [*Error.md*](https://github.com/GeoDerp/Fedora-Sway-WM-Build-/blob/master/WaybarError.md), [*Issue*](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/issues/182) (Fixed here: [Fix](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/issues/182#issuecomment-486518315))
- [ ] Load workspace script
- [ ] Figure out Waybar's overlay button problem
- [ ] Upgrade Install script, until my OCD has been met
- [ ] Upgrade Waybar with plugins and custom modules *(like weather)*
- [x] Make sure all font awesome icons work in install
- [ ] Learn how to make a GDM theme, and maybe even a Grub
- [ ] Make irssi config
- [ ] Make Atom theme, upgrade UI and add plugins *(If anyone would love to make one for his rice, that would be very much appreshiated.)*
- [ ] Upgrade Terminal then rice 
- [ ] Add Vim theme 
- [ ] Make a propper thumbnail/gif for readme.md *(Feel free to send me a image for this if you have made one)*
- [x] Turn Sway,wlroots,waybar,swaylock,swayidle build into a automated rpm to allow easy install,update and uninstall *(mainly for updates).* 
*Might use something like (open build service)[https://openbuildservice.org/] to automate the process of pulling the latest version of the git repo + the spec file and auto compile into an rpm*
[**Update:** [BUILD PACKAGES](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:GeoDerp:redflower) ]
- [x] Figure out issue with swaylock not acceptkng password [24/2/19](https://github.com/GeoDerp/Fedora-Sway-WM-Build-/commit/5db0a8b39b4cdc83d8a9ba77414aab04889958c1)
- [ ] Publish on Reddit (**Update:** I have desided that I wont personally do this, but if any of you really like this rice feel free to post it on subreddits like [*nix](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) )
- [ ] get wlstream working on OBS 
  - [ ] Add key bind in sway .config for wlstream
- [ ] check out oomox and maybe implement it 
- [x] Implement teamsilver (should work, haven't tested)
- [ ] Find all the dependencies names verients from fedora for opensuse and implement an if opensuse install for [BuildSwayInstallScript Line:69]( https://github.com/GeoDerp/SwayWM_Build/blob/8636e9792867fc92c0ad39fa12368cb2b81edab7/BuildSwayInstallScript#L69)
- [ ] check albert, not starting on boot problem
