# Images   
Welcome to the image section of this project. 
These images where taken and edited by me and are [Attribution-ShareAlike] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share-alike) so feel free to do what you wish with the image, while restricting to the limitations of course .

### Editing 
If you like to edit the image you can pull the image strait from github or download the photoshop files here:   
[.psd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/144sLUWRYIh4yTIcmRalPz8XytISiXxJ5/view?usp=sharing) (Probably only work with photoshop)  
[.tif](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dWPzzzUKu17KGFvTFsrC67RLyHViMprj/view?usp=sharing) (tiff should work with most editors)  

(would be appreciated if you keep the watermark, *feel free to modify it (to an extent) just make it legible*)



### Blank Wallpaper
If you have installed the rice and have realised that you have the **Christian variant** as your sway wallpaper (and don't like it), **have no fear**, there is a **blank** version you can change to. 

To do so, you just have to edit line 28 on the ~/.config/sway/config file using your favourite text editor:   
  from : ```output * bg ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/Wallpaper.jpg stretch ```   
  to: ```output * bg ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/Blank.jpg stretch  ``` 
  or to: ```output * bg ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/blur.png stretch ```  
Then do ```alt+shift+r``` to refresh sway and you done :)  


#### Note:
- if you get an error you may have not used a capital B in Blank.jpg, 
- if your using a file explorer to find the file and cant find the .config file go to the home directory and enable hidden files and you should see it.
